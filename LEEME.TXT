IA - Practica 1

After importing the project into Eclipse and possibly adding the necessary libraries, we can look into the AIDemo.java file.
This file contains the main-method to execute this project.

In this method we can see the line that creates the initial state:
AIState State = new AIState(400,150,s);

The parameters are in this order: number of users, number of conductors and seed.

After this line we can see the two lines that call the actual algorithms. One of those lines should be commented, only one should be executed at each time!
